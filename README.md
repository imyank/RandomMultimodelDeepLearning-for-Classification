This project is the implementation of paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01890

In this project ensemble model of CNN, LSTM, DNN has been used to provide correct architecture to be used depending on the input. 
This project is useful in such cases when the input is a combination of Text or images based on it the model identifies 
which architecture will work well.

Dataset used: 

1- IMDB(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
2-
